# Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector and Net Salary Calculator
This repository contains three toy problems implemented using javascript,HTML and css.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
The program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100. It then outputs the correct grade according to the following scheme:

A > 79
B > 60 to 79
C > 59 to 49
D > 40 to 49
E > less 40
# Challenge 2: Speed Detector
The program takes as input the speed of a car and prints the number of demerit points a driver should get for overspeeding. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints: "License suspended".

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
The program calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF deductions, and net salary of an employee given their basic salary and benefits.

# Usage
To use any of these programs, simply run the corresponding Javascript,HTML and css files in your terminal or IDE. The program will prompt you for any necessary inputs and output the results.
